# Welcome to the HOPE project GitHub Page

Here we present and share the full design of a new generation of neural implant.
We believe this implant will be benificial for the community because it is open-source, cheap, easy to build abd versatile.

## **FIGURE 4** | Optogenetic inhibition of PV cells in the striatum
(A) Schematic representation of the recording location.
(B) Histological confirmation showing the position of the recording electrodes [arrows].
(C) Averaged waveform of one isolated single unit on the four electrodes of one tetrode
(D) Autocorrelogram of the unit showed in (C) confirming there is no spikes during the firing refractory period.
(E) Raster plot of the unit showed in (C).
(F) Peri-stimulus time histogram showing reduction of the firing rate during illumination.

## **FIGURE 5** | Muscimol injeciton in the striatum
(A) Schematic representation of the recording and injection location.
(B) Experimental design.
(C) Averaged waveform of an isolated single unit from one tetrode.
(D) Autocorrelogram of the single units isolated and shown in (C).
(E) Firing rate histogram showing the time course of the firing rate before and after muscimol injection (t=0). On top of the experimental design the orange rectangles represent the period when the signal is different from the baseline period (th = 3*std). 
(F) Peri-stimulus time histogram showing reduction of the firing rate during illumination.
